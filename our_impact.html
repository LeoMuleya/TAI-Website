                    <h2>Entrepreneurship Training for Emerging Artists</h2>
                    <p>On May 9, 2024, we conducted a training program at the Global Platform in Lusaka, in collaboration with the Ministry of Sport, Youth, and Arts and the National Arts Council. We partnered with ZANACO Bank, which conducted the financial literacy session, providing artists with valuable insights into financial management. Prisca Sikana led the session on effective pricing strategies, and Chrispin Sinyangwe from Thrive Africa Initiative handled branding and marketing. The training, attended by 10 talented artists, equipped them with practical skills and knowledge, enhancing their pricing competency, financial literacy, and personal branding. Participants expressed their gratitude for the new strategies and financial management skills they acquired. Future plans include additional training sessions and continuous support for the participating artists. <em>July 2024 Edition</em></p>
